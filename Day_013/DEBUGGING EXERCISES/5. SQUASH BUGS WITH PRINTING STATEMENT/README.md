# #Print is Your Friend
```
pages = 0
word_per_page = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
total_words = pages * word_per_page
print(total_words)
```

# BUG
  - HERE IN LINE 6 it has double equals ( == ) instead of ( = ), Cause '==' is for comparing values  and '=' is for assigning values
